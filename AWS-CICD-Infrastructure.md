# AWS CI/CD Project: Full-Stack App Deployment using Elastic Beanstalk & RDS

This project was completed as part of the **‚ÄúIntroduction to DevOps‚Äù** course on **Udemy**. I learned how to deploy a full-stack application to AWS using **Elastic Beanstalk** and connect it to a cloud-hosted **Amazon RDS** database, while automating deployment with **Git + Bitbucket**.

## Tools & Technologies
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Amazon RDS (MySQL)
- Bitbucket (Version Control)
- Git & Git Bash (CLI)
- CI/CD Workflow (via auto-deploy from Bitbucket)
- EC2, S3 (via Beanstalk-managed infrastructure)
